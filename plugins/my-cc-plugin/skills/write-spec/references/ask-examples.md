# `AskUserQuestion` examples — explanatory pattern for write-prd

How step 7 (Socratic batch loop) and step 8 (critic resolution) phrase questions and options. The contract from [socratic-loop.md](./socratic-loop.md) and [critic.md](./critic.md) is normative; this file shows the **shape** of the dialogue so options *describe what the skill will do*, not just *what they're labelled*.

## Shape

- **Question**: inline the full item content verbatim (US text, AC GWT, NFR row, KPI line, critic finding) + 1 sentence framing the choice.
- **Each option**:
    - `label` — 1-4 words, action-form: «Approve as-is», «Reword», «Drop», «Save as Open Question», «Add another AC», «Override».
    - `description` — 1 sentence explaining the mechanical next step (no PRD philosophy, no design rationale).

All four item-types (US / AC / NFR / KPI) share the same 4-state machine. AC has one extra optional 5th option (`Add another AC`). `Cancel` and `Reject` are synonyms for `Drop`.

## User-story validation (step 7)

```
Question:
  US-03 (As an editor, I want to publish an article, so that readers can access it).
  Is this story right as written, needs a tweak, should be deferred, or dropped?

Options:
  - label: "Approve as-is"
    description: "Skill keeps US-03 verbatim and moves to the next item."
  - label: "Reword"
    description: "You type the new wording in one go; skill regenerates US-03 with your wording and asks once more (last call — second answer is final)."
  - label: "Save as Open Question"
    description: "Skill removes US-03 from §4 and adds «- [ ] US-03 (text) — is it valid? — owner: <you-type>, due: <you-type>» to §8. Skill asks owner+due next. Without both, the resolution downgrades to Drop with a warning."
  - label: "Drop"
    description: "Skill deletes US-03, renumbers later stories (US-04 → US-03), and AC tagged with US-03 are reassigned or dropped — skill will ask which."
```

After `Save as Open Question`, the follow-up `AskUserQuestion`:

```
Question:
  US-03 is migrating to §8 Open Questions. Provide owner and due (YYYY-MM-DD or stage trigger like "before 6.9"). Both are mandatory — without them the migration downgrades to Drop.

Options:
  - label: "Provide owner + due"
    description: "You type «owner: <name/role>, due: <date or stage>» in one line; skill applies it to the §8 entry."
  - label: "Cancel — Drop instead"
    description: "Skill abandons the OQ migration and applies Drop to US-03 (deletes + renumbers)."
```

## Acceptance-criterion validation (step 7)

The skill first renders the full proposed AC list (7a), then issues one question per AC (7b):

```
Question:
  AC-04 (US-03, domain invariant) — Given an editor owns a draft article with no
  sections, When the editor attempts to publish the article, Then the system
  blocks the publication and tells the editor that at least one section must
  exist first.
  Is this criterion right as written, needs a tweak, should be deferred, or
  dropped? You can also request one more AC for this US.

Options:
  - label: "Approve as-is"
    description: "Skill keeps AC-04 verbatim in §5 and moves to the next AC."
  - label: "Reword GWT"
    description: "You type the new Given/When/Then in one go; skill regenerates AC-04 with your wording and asks once more (last call)."
  - label: "Save as Open Question"
    description: "Skill removes AC-04 from §5 and adds «- [ ] AC-04 (text) — is this AC valid? — owner: <you-type>, due: <you-type>» to §8. Skill asks owner+due next. If coverage gate breaks (this was the only domain-invariant AC), skill regenerates a replacement of the same type."
  - label: "Drop"
    description: "Skill deletes AC-04 and renumbers later AC. If AC-04 was the only domain-invariant for US-03, skill regenerates a replacement of the same coverage type and asks about it as an extra item."
  - label: "Add another AC"
    description: "Skill generates one more AC for US-03 in a coverage type not yet present on this US (e.g. cross-context if happy + error + invariant are already covered), then asks about the new AC."
```

## NFR-row validation (step 7)

```
Question:
  NFR row — Latency p95 for publishing an article: target ≤ 250 ms, measured via
  the `articles.publish` endpoint metric.
  Is this row right as written, needs a tweak, should be deferred, or dropped?

Options:
  - label: "Approve as-is"
    description: "Skill keeps the row verbatim and moves to the next NFR row."
  - label: "Edit target"
    description: "You type the new numeric target (e.g. ≤ 400 ms); skill updates the row and asks once more (last call)."
  - label: "Save as Open Question"
    description: "Skill removes the row from §6 and adds «- [ ] NFR row «<aspect>» — is this target valid? — owner: <you-type>, due: <you-type>» to §8. Skill asks owner+due next. Without both, the resolution downgrades to Drop."
  - label: "Drop"
    description: "Skill deletes the row from §6. No replacement (NFR is recommended-list, not coverage-gated)."
```

## KPI validation (step 7)

```
Question:
  KPI — Adoption rate of article publishing: baseline 0, target ≥ 25% of active
  editors within 30 days.
  Is this KPI right as written, needs a tweak, should be deferred, or dropped?

Options:
  - label: "Approve as-is"
    description: "Skill keeps the KPI verbatim and moves to the next KPI."
  - label: "Edit baseline/target"
    description: "You type new baseline / target / timeframe; skill regenerates the KPI line and asks once more (last call)."
  - label: "Save as Open Question"
    description: "Skill removes the KPI from §7 and adds «- [ ] KPI «<name>» — is this KPI valid? — owner: <you-type>, due: <you-type>» to §8. Skill asks owner+due next. Without both, the resolution downgrades to Drop."
  - label: "Drop"
    description: "Skill deletes the KPI from §7. No replacement (KPIs are recommended-list with a ≥3 floor; if drop takes count under 3, skill regenerates one extra KPI from a remaining RICE driver)."
```

## Critic-finding resolution (step 7.5)

```
Question:
  [F1] Approach C drift after US-06 reject — §1 Context ¶3 still cites
  «Approach C: Progressive Async Learning + Social Completion», but US-06
  (peer completion) was dropped during Socratic.
  idea-brief §13 names Approach C as the Recommendation.
  Suggested: amend §1 ¶3 to drop the social-completion claim, OR add US-06 back.
  How do you want to resolve it?

Options:
  - label: "Accept revert"
    description: "Skill applies the critic's suggested amendment verbatim — §1 ¶3 rewritten to drop social-completion. US-06 stays dropped."
  - label: "Accept amendment (different wording)"
    description: "You type the alternative wording for §1 ¶3; skill applies your wording, US-06 stays dropped."
  - label: "Override"
    description: "Skill keeps §1 ¶3 unchanged and emits a bullet in §1 ¶4: «Approach C drift after US-06 drop — overridden by author, rationale: <your reason>», so downstream skills see the deliberate choice. You provide the rationale next."
```

```
Question:
  [F6] AC-02 contains forbidden tokens — line: «When editor calls POST
  /articles/{id}/publish, Then API returns 409 with code article.no_sections».
  Hits: `POST`, `/articles/{id}/publish`, `409`, `article.no_sections`.
  Suggested: rewrite into business form (actor-observable outcome) — the
  HTTP/error/schema detail moves to stage 09 `sdlc:api-forge`.
  How do you want to resolve it?

Options:
  - label: "Rewrite into business form"
    description: "Skill rewrites AC-02 as «When the editor attempts to publish the article, Then the system blocks the publication and names the missing-sections invariant», then asks once more on the new wording (last call)."
  - label: "Override"
    description: "Skill keeps AC-02 unchanged and emits a bullet in §1 ¶4: «AC-02 implementation-leak — overridden by author, rationale: <your reason>». Use this only for a quoted glossary term; technical mapping belongs in stage 09."
```

## Anti-pattern: terse option labels

```
# DON'T — option label = next mechanical step is opaque
Options:
  - Approve
  - Edit
  - Reject

# DO — option label is action-form, description names the next concrete step
Options:
  - label: "Approve as-is"
    description: "Skill keeps the item verbatim and moves on."
  - label: "Reword"
    description: "You type the new wording; skill regenerates and asks once more."
  - label: "Save as Open Question"
    description: "Skill removes the item, adds it to §8 with owner+due (asked next)."
  - label: "Drop"
    description: "Skill deletes the item and renumbers later items."
```

## Junior-friendly plain-language explanations (mandatory from 2026-05-23)

Every `AskUserQuestion` in this skill is phrased so that a **junior developer or a PM without a technical background** can understand the essence of each PRD item (US / AC / NFR / KPI), the difference between the options, and the consequences of the choice — without a helper sitting next to them. The old template («1-sentence framing», 4-word labels) is deprecated.

### Mandatory shape

1. **Plain English everywhere** — labels + descriptions. Technical identifiers (US-NN, AC-NN, NFR, KPI, GWT, AsyncAPI, OpenAPI) stay as-is — they are names; but option "actions" are spelled out in plain words («Accept as-is», «Rewrite», «Move to §8 OQ», «Delete», «Add another AC»).

2. **`question` field — 3-4 sentences** made of three blocks:
    - **FULL TEXT of the item** verbatim (US text, AC GWT, NFR row, KPI line, critic finding) — as before
    - **CONTEXT + WHY IT MATTERS** — where this item came from (which source: idea-brief / interview / NFR), which user scenario or quality vector it covers, what breaks if the item is wrong
    - **WHAT SPECIFIC JUDGEMENT IS NEEDED** — what to look at before choosing (the wording? GWT correctness? the number in the NFR? the owner in the KPI?)

3. **Option `description` — 3-5 sentences** with three mandatory elements:
    - **What technically happens in the PRD**: concretely — which line changes, which later items are affected (renumbering, AC tags get reassigned, a KPI without an owner gets downgraded)
    - **What this option actually means** in plain words, without jargon:
        - Not «GWT-form» → «the Given/When/Then format: «Given: the user is logged in; When: they click Submit; Then: 201 is returned and the resource is in the DB»»
        - Not «AC tagged with US-03 are reassigned or dropped» → «all ACs that currently reference US-03 (visible in the `AC-NN | US: US-03 | ...` rows) either move to another US or get deleted along with it — the skill will ask you about each one separately»
        - Not «cursor pagination» → «passing the last seen ID to the client»
        - Not «idempotent operation» → «you can call the same action several times and the result stays the same — a repeated publish on an already-published course doesn't change the data»
    - **Hidden trade-off** — if the option has a consequence a PM/junior might not see (e.g. «Drop on US-03 will delete 4 more ACs; all of them are tied to the core flow») — mention it **directly in the description**

### Forbidden

- Terse labels («Approve as-is», «Reword», «Drop»)
- One-line descriptions
- Technical terms without explanation (GWT, cursor, idempotent, NFR, SLA, RPO/RTO, etc.)
- Trade-offs hidden in a follow-up

### Counter-example (deprecated shape)

```
- label: "Approve as-is"
  description: "Skill keeps US-03 verbatim and moves to the next item."
```

### Correct (mandatory shape)

```
- label: "Accept US-03 as-is"
  description: "The skill keeps US-03 verbatim in §4 of the PRD and moves on to US-04 without any extra follow-ups. This means the wording of the role (editor), the intent (publish article) and the outcome (readers access) is locked in as the baseline — later changes only via re-running the skill or editing the file by hand. ACs that will be linked to US-03 (via the `US: US-03` tag in the AC table) stay valid. If the «editor» role turns out to be outdated in idea-brief §13 Recommendation, the Phase-8 critic will raise it as strategic-vector drift."
```

### Why

The user in the PRD phase is most often a PM without a deep technical background, or a junior dev who has just joined the team. Terse questions force them to stop and ask for clarification, which breaks the Socratic cadence and doubles the time spent on the PRD. Verbatim feedback quote from 2026-05-23 (translated): «The explanations need to be even clearer for people who are literally juniors in development» (context — sdlc:architecture-design, with the requirement to «build this not only into the architecture but also into the idea brief and write-prd»).
